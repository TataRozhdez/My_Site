          My favorite book: Jonathan Livingston Seagull. She teaches that
          nothing is impossible in the world and that if you want something and
          go to it with all your heart, it will come true.

        <p>My favorite quote:</p>
        <h2>&#171;Love what you do and do what you love&#187;.</h2>
